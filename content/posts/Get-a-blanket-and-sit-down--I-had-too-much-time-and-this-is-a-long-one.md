Hi you all. I am not sure how many will actually read this, but I felt like saying hi once. To my friends in ESN, Cologne from work and wherever you all moved to.

If you’re reading this you know I am in Naples. So, follow my lead:

> “When in Italy, do as the Italians do!”

Take a glass of wine, sit down and relax. This will be a long and terrible read. Or stop and keep scrolling on facebook, your choice! You’ve been warned.

### The trip down

I drove down south with Rene, my old time friend and roommate from Cologne. We ended our 5 years of living together as we were both going to start our next phases in life. To get down safe and keep my car, I spent a day fixing it up and getting it Naples ready. While the former included the typical checks, the later really just meant: Mentally accepting the fact that  *it will get scratched* and adding a GPS tracker to increase the chances of getting it back in case it gets stolen. Yes, Giorgia has warned me and now I became paranoid…

<figcaption>TL: getting ready, TR: Mannheim, BL: Breakfast thanks to Sara, BR: Chill @&nbsp;Brian</figcaption>

We stopped in Mannheim where we were hosted by the lovely Sara and then we continued to Switzerland to chill with Brian and some of the gang of my first Erasmus semester. The next day lead us through some beautiful parts of the alps. We didn’t take fast street but the back country roads to save on the toll costs. This wasn’t such a bad idea though, we listened to an audio-book and enjoyed the surroundings. They truly were stunning.

#### Entering Italy: Parma

Once we made it to Italy, we were welcomed by what I already learned to be omnipresent in Italy: Family, or what counts as such. Giorgia's godparents who live in Parma hosted us for two nights. We decided not to go to Milan, as Parma is small, cute and probably a city we will both be less likely to see in our lives. Milan surely will be on another itinerary sooner or later.

Rene and I got spoiled two days straight by the typical Italian mom cooking. We didn’t speak Italian and they didn’t speak English. And they did not know us. But they took us to the mountains and we walked around a village celebrating the time of chestnuts and buying some delicious local specialties. The Italian lifestyle started: Eat well, take your time and do things at a different pace.

#### Next Stop: Florence

After two days in Parma, we kept driving to Florence. The BnB we booked offered us two (perfectly safe ;-) ) bicycles which we promptly took to the streets. Exploring new cities with some old bikes really is a lot of fun! We also started noticing that traffic started to change a little. Scooters and bicycles became more …well let’s call it *self confident.* We followed suit and had two local beers. Good day!

#### Up on a mountain: Romantic getaway for two in Laterina

> “Lets just go somewhere in the mountains with no one to bother us so we can shut down.”

That was the idea. So we searched online for a place that looked far away from things. We’re both not the typical “ooh look another church, let’s read all about it’s history” kind of tourists. The idea of solitude and boring nothingness tempted us both. So we drove to what is called *Laterina.* A small village on a hill somewhere in Tuscany.

The arrival was a bit problematic. It turns out my 2-door Toyota is really a large car, when put into the right frame of reference..

![](/images/Get-a-blanket-and-sit-down--I-had-too-much-time-and-this-is-a-long-one/1*V0nKtLII6TaLY_XyOKrp7Q.jpeg)

Ultimately, we found a place to park the car and unpacked. The apartment was adorable and we both agreed: We like each other but this is not the place for 2 bros. It’s a place to take your girlfriend. But we didn’t wanna complain so we went to the local supermarket and tried cooking like the locals: Tomatoes, pasta, fresh Mozzarella, salt and pepper. It kind of worked. But we were soon shown how it is really done…

### Arrival in Napoli

We arrived and Giorgia welcomed us. It was all as was to be expected: Two guys, one car full with stuff and no place to put the car. We unloaded everything into the new apartment and headed to dinner. Dinner was good. And no, it was not Pizza. It was a ridiculous amount of food!

<figcaption>I believe 3+kg of meat + french fries or something</figcaption>

The next few days, Gio and I took René to our most favorite places to eat: Pizzeria 1, Pizzeria 2, Burger and of course: Giorgias home. Her parents made us a dinner that encompassed the best, the south has to offer. I think it becomes pretty clear what is important around here. Food is easily more important than Trump, right wing nationalism and Brexit combined! Just football might be able to compete against food. But honestly, not even football has a chance. Unfortunately, I didn’t take too many pictures of these days. Anytime I get a plate in front of me I seem to not think about pictures but rather just start eating. I failed twice before remembering to snap a *pic* *first* and then start eating. That explains the +5kg so far.

#### Follow the flow

I can definitely share an observation that I have made: Italians, although everyone claims them to be highly prone to being tardy, work like a swiss clock. They are highly predictable but seem not to notice this at all. Even worse (or better): They are *all synchronized!* They really seem to all work on some form of radio-controlled clock! If you go out for a run at 13:30, the streets are empty. I cannot leave my window open between 17:00 and 18:00 because the entire street is filled with cars honking at each other in the hopes that something might change. On Saturdays, there are commonly about 10–20 *groups* waiting to get a table in a local pizzeria. Don’t get me wrong: It’s not like there are too few restaurants. If you go to dinner at 19:30, you get the whole restaurant for yourself. We literally sat by ourselves until half way through the dinner once. But if you wait 1.5 hours, all of the sudden it seems like all other restaurants are closed.

<figcaption>But can you blame&nbsp;them?</figcaption>

Italians are *highly addicted* to doing things *the way things are done*. I have been reading about the effect of emergent patterns in culture lately and it is most obvious in a culture like the Neapolitans. It is not clear, why everyone is doing something in a certain way. Other cultures do it differently and there are no sudden outbreaks of mass-deaths or other catastrophes there so it doesn’t seem to be that relevant. But Neapolitans insist things need to be done in a certain way. The “right way” in this case is some softly defined cultural background noise that turns into an unspoken agreement that everyone is aware of, from the mailman to the security guard at the supermarket and your neighbors all the way into family home.

#### Geek out (feel free to skip this one)

I didn’t come here to *just* to eat pizza. That surely is a big part of my joy here but there is also work to be done. And some fun projects too of course!

I set up my new workstation which I drove all the way down here. I switched to Linux (Ubuntu Mate with Compiz to be precise). After some getting used to, I quickly started enjoying it. The keyboard shortcuts, while different, are quiet helpful and can speed up my workflows significantly.

I created a nice [conky configuration for system monitoring](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/conky/wiki/User-Configs) and setup a hopefully last 3 tier backup strategy with a 2-disk redundancy ZFS file system + an external HDD backup + an offsite PGP encrypted backup on AWS Glacier.

I also fixed up a desolated tool that was available on GitHub so that I can watch movies and get my hue lamps to adapt their colors based on the movies colors. It’s not really like I use it, but I enjoyed it while I had it running for a few days.

The 27" 4K monitor offers plenty of space and the virtual spaces of Compiz let me keep everything where I expect it. A workspace for every task!

This is great, especially once you go back to a desktop machine I found out. It’s absurd to think about shutting this one down, because it’s just going into suspend mode during the night. So I leave everything open and just commit important stuff to the file system. With plenty of RAM to host all of the applications, this is really convenient. I have a space for each of my current interests:

1.  Organisation
2.  Entertainment
3.  Website development
4.  Filemanagement
5.  Technology playground
6.  Communication tools
7.  Master Thesis
8.  University classes
9.  VM space (Lightroom mostly)

To work on the thesis, I use LaTeX for the writing and [Jupyter,](https://jupyter.org/) wrapped in a Docker with CUDA GPU acceleration for the development of code.

The topic of my thesis also allows for some fun: Reinforcement learning and letting multiple agents learn and teach each other. What this means? Well the current state-of-the-art “learning environment” is one where you teach artificial agents to play old Atari games. So it’s not the worst kind of field :-)

Otherwise, my days are rather simple. Get up, make a coffee, read some pages, go and work out a bit, read some more, code a bit, read again, eat delicious stuff, repeat. Although the keen-eyed reader will be able to tell that a bit of Roger Waters doesn’t hurt while going through a 1000 size thick book about Artificial Intelligence!

#### Cultureshift

Giorgia and I took a tour through the catacombs underneath the city a few weeks back. It was quiet an interesting experience, although the tightness in some parts was really something. 100m of 60cm wide narrow paths 30m underground can cause some increased heart rates for sure! What I found most interesting though wasn’t the catacombs that were used to bring water from the mountains some 2000 years ago. What I found telling was the fact that not too recently, the local archaeologists found a [large amphitheater](https://www.napolisotterranea.org/en/the-greco-roman-theatre/) underneath the city. Some families that lived on the ground floor had a wine cellar that they used every day for normal stuff. It turned out, it was part of a large sub terrain structure that was forgotten a while back and covered about 3 blocks. All underneath the buildings there was a large theater. Some parts were used as a garage by the residents, some as basements and cellars.

I thought Europe had a lot of history, but it’s certain that there are different degrees of history. While Cologne has lots of history and tradition, most of that is in the form of stories and only very little can be observed. Many wars and reconstructions caused most of the history to have disappeared and what is left is wrapped in museums. But here, you can’t walk through a street without running past some ancient roman artifact. It is everywhere. And that’s just the stuff thats really really old. It is hard to figure out how old the building is that I am living in. Or how long the streets have been the way they are right now.

What ends up is that the culture sort of resembles this. Things are set in a certain way and no naive German can just come over and make people do things differently just because he thinks that he might have a better idea on how to do things. It’s something I will really have to learn. Try going to the local government offices once and you will see what I mean.

#### Quick getaway back home

Originally, I wanted to write an exam on the 1st of Dec, so I booked flights to get back for a week. Well, turns out I did a classic lazy student move and forgot to sign up for the exam. It had to happen once, right? Well, didn’t matter, I had a great week with Florian, Rene, Janek and Johannes! Rock climbing, drinks, Jazz, Sauna, the whole treatment.

<figcaption>I don’t have glasses (yet), but I tried the look&nbsp;once</figcaption>

### What is next?

My mom is coming over for 3 weeks during and after Christmas. She will get to see what life is like down here and probably just enjoy the slightly higher temperatures with significantly less rain than in Germany.

Afterwards I intend to get my hands on a two-wheeled motorized vehicle. If I am lucky, It’ll be a Vespa but really any shitty scooter should do. Why in gods name do you need a scooter right? Well if your car is parked 25min walking distance from the home and the subway closes at 23:00 while parking costs 5€ per hour, a social life really becomes a luxury. So a scooter shall be my rescue. The historical center, the hotpot of nightlife, is about 45 minutes down(up?)hill walking distance away from my home. The best way to get there really is a scooter, which is why everyone here has one. I have my eye on a really cute model, let’s see how big the puppy eyes have to become until Giorgia's dad let’s me use the family Vespa. Otherwise, with some trickery I might get another cheap one for 300–400€. That is not too bad.

In the academic space, I am currently going through two classes about Data Science by Stanford and Washington State U on coursera.org, reading the “Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach” standard book on AI and following up on OpenAI, DeepMind and many other research groups’ publications on machine learning, more specifically reinforcement algorithms. The current state of my research question, for anyone with interest in the field, is the following:

> How can neural networks learn from each other in reinforcement settings?  
> Can best-peer derived training data be used to boost learning performance of  
> reinforcement algorithms?

![](/images/Get-a-blanket-and-sit-down--I-had-too-much-time-and-this-is-a-long-one/1*eomVNOdai7mqg2Eq5fL5CQ.png)

<figcaption>OpenAI cover for “Competitive Self-Play”, the closest I have found to what I am thinking&nbsp;about</figcaption>

The idea is basically to let neural networks learn from each other (peers), looking at the best in the group as a guidance to improve. The motivation comes from the way we as humans learn: In groups of students, there are usually different people with different strengths. Somebody might be better in calculus, others are better in programming. We learn from our peers if they perform better in certain subfields than us. They are better, because they spent more time on the subject or because they have a different learning history. Neural networks are most often trained in solitude, but recent Cognitive Science literature has shown that we as humans might actually are a lot less intelligent on an individual level as we like to think. Rather, we draw conclusions through our social connections and peer knowledge. I want to see if this can be applied to intelligent artificial agents as well. Anyone who is interested is welcome to hit me up about it. I am always happy to get challenged so I can develop my understanding further.

### What’s after Naples?

That is a good question. I’ll tell you when I figured it out for myself. Do you have any tips? I mean, what do you do if you’re a young couple that has had its eyes opened by all the opportunities in life and all the places you can go and live. Giorgia and I probably both get our degrees in the summer and then it’s time to go somewhere and do something. Whatever that might be.

Thanks for reading, shoot me a message if you liked it :-)
