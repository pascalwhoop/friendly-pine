Hi Chrisada,

thanks for the feedback. I tried to make it clear that I am by no means an educated data scientist or statistician and therefore I am at the mercy of my brains spontaneous ability to pick the right words that lead to the right results in my search engine. Therefore, I have not heard of Weight of Evidence before. I will read into the topic this weekend and extend my article accordingly. My aim really is to make a concise list of all possible (and ideally sensible) ways of encoding these values. Therefore I’d like to thank you again for adding another approach to the list!

I will tag you once I’ve update the article.
