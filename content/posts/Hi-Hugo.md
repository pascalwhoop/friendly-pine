Hi Hugo,

thanks for reading.

Depending on the version of covalent you are using, they changed their dependencies from a global dependency to the library to a more granular one. If you just started developing and you are running Beta 4 then look at the Changelog

[**Teradata/covalent**  
*covalent - Teradata UI Platform built on Angular Material*github.com](https://github.com/Teradata/covalent/blob/develop/docs/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-change "https://github.com/Teradata/covalent/blob/develop/docs/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-change")[](https://github.com/Teradata/covalent/blob/develop/docs/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-change)

my guess would be to import CovalentDataTableModule
