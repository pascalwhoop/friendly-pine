I don’t usually prepare much for the first call because it’s usually the “let’s go through your CV” call and I don’t like investing too much time in beginning to love a company that will not even invite me to their offices. Once I get an invititation to the offices, I’ll do the background screening of their blog, website, news etc. But until then, I don’t want to get my hopes up working for awesome company X if they don’t even invite me over once.

So yeah, if the interviewer is not prepared with a bunch of questions about the company, it could also be a simple cost-benefit calculation that is actually quiet important to perform in any situation. Really, I am just trying to suffer the [paradox of choice,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice) reducing my satisfaction with the ultimate future position because I remember all the outstanding attributes of the other foregone choices.
