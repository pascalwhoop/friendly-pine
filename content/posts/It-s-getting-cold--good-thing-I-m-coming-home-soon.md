I figured I’d share a few more thoughts with home.

> “Don’t write your friends at home, because they don’t like you. They’re just jealous so forget them”.

Those were the words the dean said at the introduction speech @ UTS. Well I don’t know what experiences he made but I’d still like to share my thoughts with my friends so here it goes. Part 3 and probably my last message from Australia. Hard to believe (at least for me) but in 2 weeks it’s already time to go home. Well almost, a month of living with an Italian family awaits and then some travel around Europe but then, then I’ll come home I promise ☺

6 weeks ago I posted the last time and the following 4 weeks were dominated by Giorgia’s visit. It was a great time and we travelled around New South Wales but of course, time flew the vacation was over all too quickly. But we made the most of it and looked at all sorts of things.

Unavoidable of course in this huge country we drove through a big bunch of nothing. But the nothing is quiet pretty and you stop more often than you think so it wasn’t that bad.

Giorgia and the sunset. Pretty much every day, we had amazing sunsets!

Spending two nights on a farm in the middle of nowhere without internet or phone service. Odd in 2016 but quiet relaxing

Doing some AirBnB in Port Macquaire, we met the most open old couple I’ve ever met. They travel all the time, and were super nice. They made cake and said we can have some (and Giorgia took half of it with us, which was kind of funny), gave us tips and had a crazy house that was full with all sorts of stuff. The man collected pretty much anything and they raided garage sales every weekend.

Obviously when you’re in the middle of nowhere and a bit of a tech nerd like I am, you want to see how these star photos look like in the actual nowhere, so I ran outside again at night and took another shot at the stars. See for yourself:

But we also looked at the things everyone needs to look at: Kangoroos, Koalas and Giraffes… wait what? OK I admit the last one was at the zoo, but come on, the view is pretty spectactular isn’t it?

We walked around the blue mountains and had a professional photographer take a nice picture of us, since he (or rather his Camera) was busy taking a bunch of timelapse pictures. His photos and videos were amazing as he recorded the blue mountains using a brand new DJI Phantom 3 Drone and showed us a short clip. I was impressed. Anyways, this conversation led to a nice portrait of the two of us.

Now, 2 weeks after Gio left, there’s Sydney Vivid, which is such a spectacle that even the FAZ newspaper (for foreign peeps, its a big German Newspaper) writes about it. I cut together a short video that is linked below and took a few pictures:

All in all, the experience in Australia was success for me. As always, it turned out that any University, once you get accustomed to it, is much less difficult than you originally think and in the end I barely spent time doing stuff for Uni. I rather worked with Propeller, got some good experiences in the startup world, travelled and did some cool sports and ate a bunch of Thai. Seriously, I’m freaking thaidicted.

Now all that is left is a open water diving course so I can go diving with Marco if we finally manage and flying to Adelaide next week to visit an old friend of my moms who has been living here for over 20 years.

I’m really looking forward to seeing you guys again though and I’m happy to live in Cologne :) why? Well the weather is shit, there’s no denying (I had to use my umbrella 3 times since I came, get that! Especially since it’s autumn which is supposed to be rainy… oh well), but we got lots of awesome things too. Good, cheap rent (come here and you’ll know why i’m saying that), nice food and people, enough clubs for fun at night and nice countrysides close by to get out a bit. Oh yeah and we got 20€ Ryanair flights to almost everywhere in Europe, everyone should really take more advantage of that! It’s always the same really. And it’s the one thing I learn over and over again and hopefully I will finally remember:

**You fly half way around the world and everyone you meet says “I want to go to where you come from so badly” and you realize, everyone just wants to go somewhere else but no one really appreciates home. It helps you put a new perspective on your home and Europeans should really notice how cool Europe is.**

Why fly to South America, Asia or Australia if you haven’t even been to Portugal, Greece, Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Norway, Sweden, Croatia, Iceland, …. Everyone wants to go to Europe, only we Europeans, we want to go somewhere else. Now that’s not right.

I’ll be back around September at the latest, and I hope everyone is up for a completely selfish welcome-myself-back party. All drinks on me ;)

Last but not least, some cheesy and cliché young couple travel the world kind of pictures… you have been warned!
