How better to show the utility than by example?

At Space Applications, so many exciting and difficult problems get attacked, it’s easy to loose track. And it probably doesn’t help that each presentation at a staff meeting contains more acronyms than the company has employees. Luckily, the internet has solved this problem long ago: Blogs

* * *

### The proposal: A two-component approach

An **internal blog**. This will help everyone get used to the idea of blogging. It will allow us to *show off and share* what we have achieved to people outside of our daily interaction bubble. But it will still protect our knowledge from the outside world and avoid potential information leakage. It will also help bridge the gaps between the different locations across Europe and the US. **Recommended tech:** [**Ghost.org**](http://loop.spaceapplications.com/)

At the same time, an **external blog**. We can identify a few people that enjoy the activity and have shown some talent in writing about their ideas and experiences to create an editorial board that can screen posts for publishing them publicly on the web. **Recommended tech:** [**medium.com**](http://medium.com/)

### Internal blog

The internal blog will be **the bulletin board of the company**. Got something to share that is noteworthy? Blog about it! **Creating a platform is easy***!* A production ready Ghost instance is up and running (thanks Vim)! It is available under [loop.spaceapplications.com](http://loop.spaceapplications.com/) (“in the *loop”)*. In short, an internal blog can:

*   help transfer and archive knowledge
*   increase visibility of currently ongoing activities
*   help finding experts within the company
*   promote discussion and collaboration
*   avoids CC storms and stops locking information in email inboxes

### External blog

An external blog will introduce a **few risks** and it should therefore be **designed more carefully**.

*   Careless information sharing of potentially secret customer information
*   Personal opinions vs. official company opinions
*   Time effort by employees
*   Management overhead

These are important points. However, we’re not the first company to create a employee-driven blog and we can learn from others. I (Pascal) personally have accompanied the transition of a 500 people firm from a clear “No, it’s too complicated!” to “Wow, this really works!” attitude by upper management. This firm faced the exact same issues as we do. NDA’s, German privacy laws and others. A few components that led to success:

*   **Editorial board** to approve postings before going public. Directors, Division and Department Managers or anyone appointed by the board
*   **trust your employees** but give them an initial “how-to guide” too, just to be sure
*   Encourage the **re-purposing of already written documents** such as software documentation, user manuals and other media that was developed and produced for a project
*   repetitive “write a post about it” comments by the main supporter of the project

The benefits of a public blog are obvious to a classic consulting firm but at least some of them directly translate to us. With the advent of commercial space exploration and an increasing commercial satellite market, even the common patterns apply to us:

*   **Customer lead generation** through visibility. When a firm performs an initial feasibility research, wouldn’t it be nice if our blog already discusses such a problem?
*   **Recruitment:** Space is cool! SpaceX is rocking that wave like no other company out there. When a university grad is looking into machine learning, stumbling on one of our posts about how to deploy ML to guide satellites in space, how perfect that the bottom of the post has an “open positions” hint with a link to our website!
*   **Second level visibility:** There are a bunch of podcasts, websites, news pages and general enthusiasts out there. From [Data Science](https://lineardigressions.com/) to [space related](http://planetary.org) all the way to [general knowledge](https://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/podcasts/) podcasts, they all require content. When we are more visible, they are more likely to notice us. This in turn permits us to open yet another channel of visibility!
*   **Sharpen focus:** Telling a story and explaining what you do helps you learn yourself. Although [the cone of learning seems to be a bit misunderstood](https://www.worklearning.com/2015/01/05/mythical-retention-data-the-corrupted-cone/), it is still obvious to any self-reflected human being that putting thoughts into words helps order them and clarify a story.
*   **Allow a wide range of topics:** Project management, software engineering, hardware engineering, business development, they all are worth talking about. It allows any of our employees to profile themselves a bit, helping everyone's personal development.
*   **It’s fun and inspiring:** When we look past the bottom line, it’s just a nice thing to share knowledge. It’s fun for those that share it, as well as for those that can consume it.

### Bottom line

E-Mail is a great invention. But there is a saying among engineers:

> “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail!”

E-Mail *is not made* for large scale 1:N information sharing among a varying population of people with a range of interests. Blogs let **the receiver select the information they choose to consume**. They **reduce cognitive load** and keep the E-Mail inbox clear of noise. Let’s move forward. Inside of the company and outside as well. It fits our agenda to modernize our brand image and will help us cope with the growing complexity and scale of the company.
