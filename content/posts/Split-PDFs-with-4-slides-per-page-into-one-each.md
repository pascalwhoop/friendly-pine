I am using [Sejda-Console](http://www.sejda.org/shell-interface/tutorial/) on MacOS

1.  download [sejda-console](https://github.com/torakiki/sejda/releases/download/v2.7/sejda-console-2.7-bin.zip) and make it so that sejda is in the path as “sejda”
2.  Create a folder
3.  in this folder create a script.sh file with the content of the snippet below
4.  Put all pdfs into a folder inside the previously created folder called ‘in’
5.  run the script
