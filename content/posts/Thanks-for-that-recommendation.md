Thanks for that recommendation. I will look into it. Although I appreciate the application and I am certainly willing to pay for software, I don’t like that you \*have\* to create an account with mailspring. I don’t want any of the features that require an account. I just want a nice client for my IMAP/SMPT/GMAIL whatever. There really \*should\* be a “skip account creation” button
