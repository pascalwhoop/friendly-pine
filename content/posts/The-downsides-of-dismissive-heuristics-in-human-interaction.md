Many of us have been in this situation before: A colleague tells us about a technology, a customer, a trend. A relative tells us about a disease, or a crazy neighbor. But we dismiss it or do not pay much attention to it and quickly forget about it. We never even considered it or if we did, quickly interpreted it as *non-relevant*. Then, a few months later, this colleague makes thousands on this customer, the new tech leads to startups making billions or the neighbor you dismissed finally snaps and shoots your dog that always barks at night.

In our current lives, we all have a hundred things in our heads. We are thinking about several things at once and constantly multi-task, which causes actual changes in how our brains work. Time magazine turned this into a mean article saying that [You Now Have a Shorter Attention Span Than a Goldfish](http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/).

So we dismiss information. Every day, all the time. Its heuristics and our brain needs to filter to stay on top of the continuous flood of new data coming in. But there are moments when we wish we had listened better. The mentioned cases above are extreme, but they occur non the less. They trigger regretful thoughts like ‘had I only listened’ or ‘why didn’t I act then’.

#### What psychology says

Norbert Schwarz, Provost Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Schwarz#Feelings_as_Information)), came up with the ‘feeling as information’ theory, claiming that many human decisions judging certain topics are based on feeling. Not feelings of another time but the feelings they have right now. This leads hungry men to like chubby women and rainy days to cause people to be subjectively less happy about their lives. This can also lead us to ignore information, because we currently do not feel like it has relevance to us.

But how do we register these situations, how do we act before its too late? How can we improve the heuristics, keep their positive effect of filtering out 99% of the irrelevant information without suffering those painful 1% of false negatives? Especially since, for now, those improvements have to be made in our behavior and in our mind, not in computer algorithms that automatically run through data.

I will not have an answer to this problem by the end of this article. So if you are looking for a quick self-improvement and *how to make millions with this simple trick* kind of writing, look elsewhere. I will instead discuss the recent case that led me to write about this and discuss which cases a healthy human being capable of empathy can live with and which ones it can not.

### The story of the volcano I did not see

This is going to be an anecdote of mine but stick with me here. I will make a point that I think every American will gasp at and anyone with some form of risk averse attitude towards life will agree with.

#### Naples

So, my girlfriend lives in Italy, somewhere close to Naples. For those that don’t know it (I’m not judging…much) that is the city where Pizza comes from. Its also the city that is situated right at the foot of the Vesuvius, the volcano that destroyed Pompeii in 79.

Below are some photos of how I saw Naples in my mind. A vivid city full of tight streets, crazy scooter drivers without helmets and a beautiful nature surrounding it.

Now let’s get to the numbers. There are 3.1 Million people living in the province of Naples, meaning the whole bay surrounding the Vesuvius mountain. The last big eruption by the prominent Vesuvius killed thousands but as it was 2000 years ago (with several smaller eruptions later), it is a mythical story that serves as a base for some Hollywood movies. Officials observe the volcano very closely and can give the population a warning before it may erupt again. However, the volcano is not expected to erupt as brutally as it did in 79AD, allowing for reasonable evacuation plans for about 600.000 people. Overall, although some lives would surely be lost, the contingency plans sound reasonable, the ability to predict an eruption is sufficiently supported by scientists and the global effects would be small.

#### Phlegraean Fields

So when I first came to Naples and my girlfriend told me that they ‘have a volcano in Pozzuoli, too’, I was dismissive. Sure I thought, so where is it? I looked on the Map and found it soon after, also going past it for a jog that week.

It does not look too intimidating right? Well there are some attractions regarding volcanos in that region but overall it did not seem significant. We were planing to go to Iceland and I intended to get my dose of volcanos from there.

I dismissed it completely. Until very recently when she sent me a good morning message and said that it was snowing in Naples for the first time and that there are warnings about their volcano erupting. So I researched about the volcano for the first time. I was lying in bed with my tablet and had some time to spare so why not.

**±40.000 years ago,** the [Campanian Ignimbrite eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanian_Ignimbrite_eruption) occurred which was one of the largest volcanic eruptions Europe has seen since the dawn of humanity, erupting about 500 km³ of lava, half the size of the latest eruption of the super volcano under the Yellowstone National Park. Yes you heard correctly. It’s not a tiny little bubbling baby volcano as would be expected from the picture above. It’s last big eruption was half as big as the [Lava Creek eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_Creek_Tuff) in Yellowstone, which created an ash bed from LA to North Dakota to Houston, Texas.

So, coming back to Europe, what does this really mean? Well the last eruption is a few thousand years ago, but the effects were significant. The graphic below shows the spread of the ash. Anything south of the Naples area was covered in 10cm of ash, all of Greece and large parts of Eastern Euope all the way into Kasakhstan in the far east have been covered in ash.

In 2012, Reuters published an [article](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-volcano-idUSBRE8720WI20120803), pointing out the super volcano that is placed just west of Naples and which threatens millions of lives. A project was proposed to drill into the ground and allow scientists to get more precise readings of the current state of the magma chambers but it has been aborted due to concerns that the drilling itself could already trigger an eruption. Thankfully, the newly elected major had the drillings resumed, arguing that there have been drillings in the past that were not motivated by science but by economic incentives that were fare less careful.

> “These areas can give rise to the only eruptions that can have global catastrophic effects comparable to major meteorite impacts,” — Giuseppe De Natale, Research Director

Now that sounds less positive all of the sudden. You can imagine my tension to rise, early on a Saturday morning and that is the news you get. So I looked for the exact scale that they are talking about and it turns out, the ‘small volcano’ is actually a 13km wide caldera that has been covered by 40k years of erosion. It is several times the size of the Vesuvius mountain though and her house, as well as those of a Million other people, is actually *inside* of the caldera.

A recent paper by Chiodini et al. published in the Nature Communications Journal describes the current state of the Phlegraean Fields, also called Campi Flegrei, which have undergone some significant changes in recent years. There have been ground uplifts in 2012–2013 which has been interpreted as magma intrusion at a depth of 3km. There have been a 15 year long exponential increase in CO emissions from the fumaroles (the openings that often emit gases or hot water). All signs apparently say: eruption imminent, only a matter of a few years now. (Read more [here](http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms13712))

#### Back to topic

Now what does this have to do with the topic which is asking why we just dismiss information that might be crucial to us. Well it is because she had told me that there was a volcano. She might not have known the scale of it and the significance of it but she pointed it out to me anyways and offered that we would go and look at it once. I declined, due to lack of interest, lack of knowledge or simply because my *acute physical feeling* led me to judge it as irrelevant. I felt safe so I did not see it as a threat and I was not interested in volcanos at that moment so I ignored it.

Imagine the thing went up in the last few weeks. Aside from the global relevance, the regret I would have felt is tremendous. I am trying to make her spend as little time as possible down there now as we already planned to move somewhere else but she still has to finish a degree at the local University.

But what can I or we learn from this? How does one avoid missing the ground breaking (no pun intended) information that is right in front of us?

There are two approaches that I can see:

1.  Try a bunch of **self improvement literature** and try to make oneself a ‘better being’, one that is more aware and ‘sees things for what they are’. Sure, you can try this. I don’t believe in these things however, there is only so much you can do
2.  **Focus your attention** to a limited number of information sources and value those sources. Your **5 most important humans** for example. Mother, father, partner, children, mentor, professor, …

I believe the second approach is, although also somewhat voodoo, is something that even for a rationalist can make a lot of sense. You can forgive yourself for making mistakes or not seeing and knowing everything but not having listened to someone very important is much harder to get over.

Do you have a better idea? Do you have a strategy for ensuring you don’t miss out on such things, trick yourself into not employing the feeling as information heuristic, ponder over each piece of information you get without sacrificing your ability to function in this world? Let me know, I’d like to learn from it.

And regarding the bigass volcano that might cover half of Europe in ash? Well I suppose with all the current things going on on our planet, it is just one more of the many risks that lurk around the corner. Let’s just hope someone finds a way to precisely predict it so we can react appropriately when we need to.
