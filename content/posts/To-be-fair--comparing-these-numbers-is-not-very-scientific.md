To be fair, comparing these numbers is not very scientific. One organization may not notify publicly about every small bug and unexpected API error while others may do so. Looking at statusgator’s log on Google, things like “issues when creating new databases via the CLI” are triggering an event on statusgator.

That said, I have heard anecdotal reports of firebase having issues with downtime which is why I am here in the first place.
